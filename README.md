Rocketgate Gateway PHP Legacy (Pre PHP 5.7) SDK
===========

This library is __compatible__ with PHP 5.6, although we highly recommend
to migrate your project to PHP 7.2 or greater to avoid security breaches 
(refer to PHP Supported Versions [here](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)).

PHP 7 or greater users should use the https://github.com/rocketgate/rocketgate-php-sdk repo which has support for Namespaces and Composer
